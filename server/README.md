This backend is written using FastAPI (https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and configured for a local mysql database although this can be changed in `./server/dbmysql/database.py` - changes may require more dependencies to be installed using pip.

To get the backend up and running, follow the instructions in the readme in the root of the project.

To get the docs for the API designed here, go to `localhost:8000/docs` or `localhost:8000/redoc` once the backend is running.
